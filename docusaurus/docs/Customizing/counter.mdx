## Raw Code

This is the raw code which will be downloaded at time of building the portfolio.
:::info
Portfolio Generator will ask you for data which can replace the variables.
If you don&apos;t enter correct data, then you can change variables manually also.
:::

```js title=Data/Counter.js
const counterItems = [[items]];

export default counterItems;
```

## Variables

:::caution
You can refer this table if you have any kind of confusion regarding adding data into variables.
Remember variables are very sensitive respect to their types and data format.
Data should be added in the instructed format only.
:::

| Variable    | Description           | Type | Constraint    | Example |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---- | ------------- | ------- |
| **items\*** | List of counter items | List | Length 2 to 4 |         |

:::info
Data which will be asked by `portfolio-generator` for variable marked as **\*** will be in different format.
:::

### Data Asked by `portfolio-generator` for variable `items`

| Variable         | Description                      | Type    | Constraint     | Example             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| **itemsCount\*** | Number of items in list          | Integer | Value 2 to 4   |                     |
| icon             | Name of bootstrap icon class     | Text    |                | `bi bi-globe`       |
| count            | Number upto animation should run | Integer |                |                     |
| duration         | Duration of animation in seconds | Integer |                | 2                   |
| title            | Title of item                    | Text    | Length 3 to 25 | Years of Experience |

:::tip

- `itemsCount` will be asked only once.
- Then all variables will be asked `itemsCount` times i.e. once for each item.

:::

## Final Code Example

After adding the data, the code will look like:

```js title=Data/Contact.js
const counterItems = [
  { icon: "bi bi-globe", count: 50, duration: 1, title: "Websites" },
  { icon: "bi bi-phone", count: 10, duration: 1, title: "Android Apps" },
  {
    icon: "bi bi-currency-bitcoin",
    count: 3,
    duration: 1,
    title: "Web 3.0 Apps",
  },
  {
    icon: "bi bi-lightbulb-fill",
    count: "2",
    duration: 1,
    title: "Years of Experience",
  },
];

export default counterItems;
```
