## Raw Code

This is the raw code which will be downloaded at time of building the portfolio.
:::info
Portfolio Generator will ask you for data which can replace the variables.
If you don&apos;t enter correct data, then you can change variables manually also.
:::

```js title=Data/Skills.js
const skills = [[skillList]];

export default skills;
```

## Variables

:::caution
You can refer this table if you have any kind of confusion regarding adding data into variables.
Remember variables are very sensitive respect to their types and data format.
Data should be added in the instructed format only.
:::

| Variable        | Description                    | Type      | Details            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| **skillList\*** | Generated list for skill items | List Code | [View](#skillList) |

:::info
Data which will be asked by `portfolio-generator` for variable marked as **\*** will be in different format.
:::

<br />

### Data Asked by `portfolio-generator` for variable `skillList` {#skillList}

| Variable    | Description           | Type    | Constraint     | Example |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------- |
| **Count\*** | Number of skill items | Integer |                |         |
| Skill Name  | Name of skill         | Text    | Max length 30  | Python  |
| Skill Value | Value out of 100      | Integer | Value 0 to 100 | 95      |

:::tip

- `Count` will be asked only once.
- Then all variables will be asked `Count` times i.e. once for each skill item.

:::

## Final Code Example

```js title=Data/Skill.js
const skills = [
  { title: "Python", value: 95 },
  { title: "React", value: 95 },
  { title: "Next", value: 90 },
  { title: "Flask", value: 92 },
  { title: "HTML", value: 85 },
  { title: "Blockchain", value: 80 },
  { title: "Bootstrap", value: 80 },
  { title: "Javascript", value: 80 },
  { title: "C++", value: 80 },
  { title: "Flutter", value: 80 },
  { title: "C", value: 75 },
  { title: "Java", value: 75 },
  { title: "Machine Learning", value: 70 },
  { title: "Artificial Intelligence", value: 70 },
