## Downloaded Code

This is the raw code which will be downloaded at time of building the portfolio.
:::info
Portfolio Generator will ask you for data which can replace the variables.
If you don&apos;t enter correct data, then you can change variables manually also.
:::

```js title=Data/About.js
let currDate = new Date();
let year = currDate.getFullYear() - [[birthYear]];
let month = currDate.getMonth() - [[birthMonth]];
let date = currDate.getDate() - [[birthDate]];

const givenDate = new Date([[birthYear]], [[birthMonth]] - 1, [[birthDate]]);
const birthday = givenDate
  .toLocaleDateString("en-GB", {
    day: "numeric",
    month: "short",
    year: "numeric",
  })
  .replace(/ /g, "-");

if (month < 0) year -= 1;
else if (month === 0) {
  if (date < [[birthDate]]) year -= 1;
}

const about = {
  name: "[[name]]",
  about: "[[about]]",
  bio: "[[shortBio]]",
  longBio: "[[longBio]]",
  birthday,
  city: "[[city]]",
  age: year,
  degree: "[[degree]]",
};

export default about;
```

## Variables

:::caution
You can refer this table if you have any kind of confusion regarding adding data into variables.
Remember variables are very sensitive respect to their types and data format.
Data should be added in the instructed format only.
:::

:::tip

- Some variables are marked as **\*** in above table.
  Those variables will not be asked directly in `portfolio-generator`.
- Instead a variable named `dob` will be asked.
- You are expected to add your complete date of birth in that variable.

## Final Code Example

After adding the data, the code will look like:

```js title=Data/About.js
let currDate = new Date();
let year = currDate.getFullYear() - 2000;
let month = currDate.getMonth() - 1;
let date = currDate.getDate() - 1;

const givenDate = new Date(2000, 1 - 1, 1);
const birthday = givenDate
  .toLocaleDateString("en-GB", {
    day: "numeric",
    month: "short",
    year: "numeric",
  })
  .replace(/ /g, "-");

if (month < 0) year -= 1;
else if (month === 0) {
  if (date < 1) year -= 1;
}
