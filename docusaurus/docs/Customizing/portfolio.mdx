## Raw Code

This is the raw code which will be downloaded at time of building the portfolio.
:::info
Portfolio Generator will ask you for data which can replace the variables.
If you don&apos;t enter correct data, then you can change variables manually also.
:::

```js title=Data/Portfolio.js
// Filters
[[filterVariables]];

const filters = [[filterList]];

const generateFilterString = (...fils) => {
  return Array.from(fils).join(" ");
};

// URL Types
[[urlVariables]];

// Category Types
const cat_types = [[catTypes]];

// Projects
const projects = [[projectList]];

// Get Details
const getDetails = (id) => {
  if (!id || id < 0 || id >= projects.length) return projects[0];

  const pr = projects[id];
  let fils_ = pr.filter.split(" ");
  let cats_ = [];
  fils_.forEach((el) => {
    cats_ = [...cats_, cat_types[el]];
  });
  let cat = cats_.join(", ");
  pr["category"] = cat;

  return pr;
};

export default { filters, projects, getDetails };
```

## Variables

:::caution
You can refer this table if you have any kind of confusion regarding adding data into variables.
Remember variables are very sensitive respect to their types and data format.
Data should be added in the instructed format only.
:::

| Variable              | Description                         | Type        | Details                  |

## Final Code Example

After adding the data, the code will look like:

```js title=Data/Portfolio.js
// Filters
const game_filter = "filter-game";
const web_filter = "filter-web";
const desktop_filter = "filter-desktop";
const ai_filter = "filter-ai";
const android_filter = "filter-android";
const blockchain_filter = "filter-blockchain";

const filters = [
  game_filter,
  web_filter,
  desktop_filter,
  ai_filter,
  android_filter,
  blockchain_filter,
];

const generateFilterString = (...fils) => {
  return Array.from(fils).join(" ");
};

// URL Types
const git = "Github";
const playstore = "Playstore";
const setup = "Setup";
const web = "Website";

// Category Types
const cat_types = {
  [game_filter]: "Game",
  [web_filter]: "Website",
  [desktop_filter]: "Desktop App",
  [ai_filter]: "Artificial Intelligence",
  [android_filter]: "Android App",
  [blockchain_filter]: "Blockchain",
};

// Projects
const projects = [
  {
    name: "Face Detector",
    filter: generateFilterString(ai_filter, desktop_filter),
    img: "face_detector",
    desc: [
      "It is an AI project to detect your face & eyes either by live webcam, uploaded photo or video.",
      "Made in python using OpenCV.",
    ],
    urls: [
      [[git], "https://github.com/cybersaksham/Face-Detector"],
      [
        [setup],
        "https://github.com/cybersaksham/Face-Detector/raw/master/setup_face_detector.exe",
      ],
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "INC",
    filter: generateFilterString(web_filter, blockchain_filter),
    img: "inc",
    desc: [
      "INC(Indian National Coin) is a demo crypto-currency made in motoko.",
      "You can view, transfer & receive INC coins on this website",
    ],
    urls: [[[git], "https://github.com/cybersaksham/INC"]],
  },
];

// Get Details
const getDetails = (id) => {
  if (!id || id < 0 || id >= projects.length) return projects[0];

  const pr = projects[id];
  let fils_ = pr.filter.split(" ");
  let cats_ = [];
