Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

## `npm start`

- Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

## `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed.

## `npm run start`

- Runs the production bundle in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- Running the script `npm run build` is necessary to build the production bundle. Otherwise, this script will not run.
