## Create .env file

:::tip
This step is optional. Do this only if you want to enable the feature of contact emails from your website.
:::

Create `.env` file at root level.

Generate OAuth client credentials for an email id at Google Developer Console.

Add these values in that file.

`FRONTEND_URL` is passed to enable cors features. It will allow backend requests only from given frontend.

All these values are necesary in order to enable contact form in website.

Adding this file is optional. If you don't add this file then people will not be able to contact you directly by your website.

```env title=.env
FRONTEND_URL=<Url where frontend is hosted>
MAIL_USERNAME=<Your email id>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<Your email password>
OAUTH_CLIENTID=<Generated OAuth Client ID>
