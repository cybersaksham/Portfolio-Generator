# [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Step 1: Create Repository {#step1}

Create an account at https://github.com if you don't have one.

Go to https://github.com/new

Enter repository details to create a repository.

## Step 2: Add `homepage` to `package.json` {#step2}

:::note

- **The step below is important!**<br/>
- **If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.**

:::

Open your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field for your project:

```json
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
```

or for a GitHub user page:

```json
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io",
```

or for a custom domain page:

```json
  "homepage": "https://mywebsite.com",
```

## Step 3: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json` {#step3}

Now, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.

```bash
npm install --save gh-pages
```

Add the following scripts in your `package.json`:

```diff
  "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
```

:::note
The `predeploy` script will run automatically before `deploy` is run.
:::

## Step 4: Push code to GitHub {#step4}

Copy link of repository created in [Step 1](#step1)

```bash
git init
git remote add <paste link here>
git add .
git commit -m "Deployment"
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 5: Deploy the site

Then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Step 6: For a project page, ensure your project's settings use `gh-pages`

Finally, make sure **GitHub Pages** option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:

  alt="gh-pages branch setting"
/>

## Step 7: Optionally, configure the domain

You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

Your CNAME file should look like this:

```
mywebsite.com
```
